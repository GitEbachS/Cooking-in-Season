# COOKING IN SEASON

An app that helps the user to create new recipes and organize recipes of their choosing. The develper can save specific recipes that other developers created and organize each recipe by a certain season. They will have the ability to add their own personal notes for each recipe, and they can save the recipe to a 'Meal-Rotation-List'.

This application is necessary to motivate users to get out of their basic-routine style of cooking and get into the spirit of cooking with seasonal options! Cooking dishes that help amplify the spirit of a certain season for the User is fun, creative, and a great way to make seasonal memories. The primary user of the application will be 'recipe-organizers'; the secondary user will be recipe developers. The final type of user will be those who would like to use the app assist with their meal-rotation schedule.

## Get Started 
First, clone this repo. Pick your favorite text editor. In your terminal, enter the following:

```
npm run dev
```
This will stand the live server. Authenticate with your email - organizing or creating your recipe awaits!

## About the User 
The user is one or each of the following:
- one who is interested uploading new recipes to share with other people. Only THEY can edit, delete, or update the recipes that they upload.
- one who would like to browse the recipes that others have posted and save certain interesting recipes to their personal list. In this private recipe list, they can view their recipes by Fall, Winter, Summer, or Spring. They can choose to upload their own personal notes on ANY recipe in the app. Only the user can view, edit, delete, and update their personal notes.
- one who would like to use the Meal-Rotation to organize their recipes into a maximum of 8 weeks. They can only view the recipe from each of those days.

Ideally, users will authenticate through FireBase Auth, and utilize the Firebase database system to create/edit/update/view: recipes, personal saved recipes, notes, meal rotation schedule.
